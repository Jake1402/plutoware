### DISCLAIMER : I DO NOT CONSENT FOR THIS SOFTWARE TO BE USED MALICIOUSLY

# Plutoware
Plutoware is an extremely simple ransomware software which I made as an experiment to learn and understand better how ransomwares works. This works by encrypting all user directories but not system ones. Total encryption on my PC at the time took roughly 15 minutes, and decryption was similar (based off memory). The directories encrypted include: Desktop, Photos, Music, Videos, and Documents. The software also attacks a lot of common file extensions for example .bmp, ,jpeg, .html. In total over 34 different file extensions can be encrypted by Plutus. The key for Plutus is `4bf229e792f4ff18b1baccb7785ca743b9af297101f64be005e1cc19ed0b206` I once again DO NOT ALLOW THE USE OF PLUTUS FOR MALICIOUS MEANS. 

### Features:
Plutoware has the following features:
- Restart safety, files can still safely be decrypted even if this restarts during the process.
- Full UI, Plutus features a full UI.
- AES256 encryption.
